# README Generator

![License Badge](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

This node app is a command line tool that can be run to generate a professional README file based on user input. The project uses the inquirer library to prompt the user to enter information for the README including the title, description, usage, contributing, testing, license, and questions sections. The app then generates a README.md file in the output directory, and includes a table of contents. This is handy and reduces the manual labor of having to remember markdown syntax and doing it every time per app.

## Usage

To run the app, open a Terminal run "node index.js" to run the application. This assumes you have nodejs already installed on your machine. If not, go to the https://nodejs.org/en/download to install it. Below is a screenshot that shows what the command line will look like.
